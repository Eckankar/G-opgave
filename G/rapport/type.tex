\chapter{Type checker}

The type checker is implemented in \texttt{Type.sml}. The following changes
were made made to implement the remainder of the Cat language:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {
        The remaining types were added to \texttt{checkType}.
    }
    \item {
        The remaining patterns were added to \texttt{checkPat}, which
        checks a pattern and returns a symbol table for variables. For
        \texttt{Cat.TupleP} it was necessary doing a recursive check using
        \texttt{foldr}.
    }
    \item {
        The majority of the changes were made in \texttt{checkExp}, which does
        type checking on a Cat expression. The remaining expressions were
        added to ensure that expressions are valid according to the semantics
        in Cat. Checking \texttt{let} expressions is done by converting it to
        an equivalent \texttt{case} expression using the \texttt{letToCase}
        function that has been added as well.
    }
    \item {
        A symbol table containing the type declarations is made using the
        \texttt{getTyDecs} function. These are then checked for validity by
        \texttt{checkTyDec}. Calls to these functions have been added to
        \texttt{checkProgram}, which is also declared in \texttt{Type.sig} and
        is the main function for the type checker.
    }
\end{enumerate}
